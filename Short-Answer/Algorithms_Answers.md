#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) - scales linear with size of n

b) O(n^2) - the runtime complexity = the number of times the inner loop runs

c) O(n) -

## Exercise II

Use binary search to find f.
Runtime complexity: O(logn)

In a sorted list of floors we change the middle floor value (top floor + ground floor / 2 to find middle floor) each time we pass through the list and are able to eliminate half of the floors each time.
